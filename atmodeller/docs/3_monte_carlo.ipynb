    "When performing a MC simulation, sometimes problems can arise when chosen model parameters would result in a solution that is far from the initial guess. Internally, atmodeller chooses an initial guess for the solution and uses this as a starting point for the numerical solution technique. But if this initial guess is far from the actual solution, the solver may fail. To address this, it is often convenient to run a smaller MC simulation with reduced parameter bounds in order to generate some output. Then we can use this output to train a new initial condition to provide an improved initial guess for a new MC run.\n",

Also, fit = True allows you to train an initial condition on a similar but not identical model (for example, different solubility laws or gas equations of states), where once enough samples have been generated you would prefer to only use the new model to generate new estimates (since the behavior of the new model and the previous similar-but-not-the-same model will diverge).\n",

    "Although it is tempting to set fit_batch_size to as small a number as possible to begin training the initial condition, formally this initial sample should capture some of the variability in the solution since it is used to calibrate the scalings. This is important because the scalings are fixed for an initial condition regressor and are not updated (unlike the trained model) during partial fitting. Hence in practice, it may be necessary to incrementally add complexity in terms of solubility and equations of state, where the initial condition for each MC is trained on a previous simpler MC run."
