"""Parameter containers for thermodynamic calculations.

This module defines immutable, JAX-friendly parameter objects used by the solver:

- :class:`ActivityConstraintSet`: stores per-species activity/fugacity constraints.
- :class:`MassConstraintSet`: stores elemental abundance constraints in moles.
- :class:`Parameters`: bundles state, constraints, and solver settings into one object.

Factory methods validate and normalize user inputs, while ``update`` methods return new instances
with leaf shapes kept stable for efficient JAX transformations, also within jitted workflows.

Note:
    Construct parameter containers once outside ``jit`` (or other JAX transforms), then use
    ``update`` methods to preserve leaf signatures and avoid unnecessary retracing.
